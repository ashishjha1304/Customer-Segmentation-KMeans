## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Loaded dataset and explored structure
   - Handled missing values and outliers

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardized and transformed features
   - Performed feature engineering for clustering

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized customer demographics and purchase behavior
   - Analyzed correlations and campaign performance

4. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Used Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters
   - Applied K-Means to segment customers
   - (Optional) Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization

5. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Analyzed each customer segment
   - Suggested business strategies based on cluster characteristics

## 📊 Key Results

- Identified **X** optimal customer segments
- Each cluster demonstrated distinct patterns in:
  - Income and spending behavior
  - Age and family structure
  - Campaign responsiveness
